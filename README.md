# Obsidian Math Commands Plugin

**Math Commands Plugin** provides convenient shortcut commands for typing using LateX, MathJax, and other math-related formats.

In addition to default commands such as "Add Formulas" and "Add Parentheses," it also allows users to create custom commands.

## Create Custom Commands

To create custom commands, you need to add elements to the "commands" field in the data.json file located in the plugin's source directory (usually : `your-vault/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-mathcommands-plugin/data.json`).
